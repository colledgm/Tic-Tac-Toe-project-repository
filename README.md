# Tic-Tac-Toe-project-repository


Materials:
-1 Arduino Uno.
-a large enough bread board/collection of breadboards of fit the project. (I found 2 long narrow ones did me well, but you could try more if you want to do something imressive)
-20 LEDs, 10 each of 2 colors.
-19 330 ohm Resistors.
-6 680 ohm Resistors I instead had to use 6 120 ohm resistors and 6 6 ohm resistors, but it worked).
-1 push buttons.
-A large amount of wire. Prepare sme long stuff too, it may have to reach from the arduino across your board.
